# Vet clinic project

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

### First of all you will need to create your database. You can do it by running the following command on your terminal:
`CREATE DATABASE 'thenameofyourdatabase';`
And then move to that database, you can do it by:
- \c thenameofyourdatabase

or

- Restart your terminal and open your new database in your server.

### Then you can:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
